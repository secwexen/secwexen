# Clipboard Watcher

This tool monitors the user's system clipboard in real time and alerts when suspicious content is detected — such as email addresses, IP addresses, or credit card numbers.

## Purpose

The goal is to help users identify potential data leaks on their own system.  
It does **not** transmit or store any data externally.  
This tool is designed for **awareness**, not exploitation.

## Features

- Real-time clipboard monitoring
- Pattern detection using regular expressions
- Alerts for sensitive data types:
  - Email addresses
  - IP addresses
  - Credit card numbers
- Lightweight and ethical — runs locally

## Usage

```bash
python tools/clipboard_watcher.py
```

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for personal and educational use only.
Running it on someone else's system without consent is unethical and may be illegal.

# I'm stronger with every line of code. Closer with every vulnerability. | 🛡️ CyberSecurity & Ethical Hacking

## 👋 Hi, I’m @X99874  
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for ethical hacking, digital defense, and finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

With a strong commitment to safeguarding digital assets, I focus on understanding the tactics and techniques used by attackers in order to stay one step ahead.

My goal is to strengthen digital environments by anticipating and analyzing potential threats, ensuring systems remain resilient against evolving cyber attacks and emerging risks. I specialize in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, malware analysis, and incident response, constantly refining my skills through hands-on experience and continuous learning.

Driven by curiosity and a proactive mindset, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, develop custom security challenges, and explore advanced topics such as reverse engineering and exploit development. I believe that true cybersecurity is a continuous process of learning, adapting, and innovating to protect our increasingly connected world.

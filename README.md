  Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Specialist
</h1>

## 👋 Hi, I’m @X99874  

I am a cybersecurity-focused professional with a deep passion for ethical hacking, digital defense, and identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. My work is driven by a strong commitment to protecting digital assets and understanding the adversarial mindset — not to imitate it, but to stay ahead of it.

I focus on analyzing and anticipating potential threats, strengthening systems against evolving cyberattacks, and ensuring resilience in increasingly complex digital environments. My technical expertise spans penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, malware analysis, and incident response — all reinforced through hands-on experience and continuous learning.

Rather than relying solely on theory, I actively design custom security scenarios, explore advanced topics such as reverse engineering and exploit development, and build tools that simulate real-world attack vectors in controlled environments. This practical approach allows me to understand how systems fail, so I can help ensure they don’t.

I believe cybersecurity is not a destination but a discipline — one that demands curiosity, precision, and adaptability. In a world where threats evolve daily, I strive to evolve faster. My mission is to contribute to a safer digital future by combining ethical research, technical excellence, and strategic foresight.

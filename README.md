# Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Expert

## About Me

I am a cybersecurity professional specializing in **ethical hacking, digital defense, and vulnerability assessment**.  
My primary focus is on proactively identifying and mitigating risks before they can be exploited by malicious actors.  
I am strongly committed to safeguarding digital assets and anticipating adversarial tactics to remain one step ahead.  

In addition to my cybersecurity expertise, I have a solid background in **software development**.  
I design and implement Python-based tools for automation, threat intelligence, and SIEM optimization.  
By integrating security and software engineering, I deliver efficient, resilient, and intelligent defense solutions.  

**I've been pursuing this journey with passion since 2022.**

## Vision

My goal is to master every domain of cybersecurity — from threat intelligence to digital forensics, protocol analysis to security automation. I believe true expertise comes from understanding the full spectrum: attack, defense, detection, and response. I build tools, study behaviors, and explore systems to uncover how security truly works — end to end.

---

## Why Cybersecurity?

Because every system hides a story — of trust, logic, and flaws.  
Exploring these layers isn't just about breaking things;  
it's about understanding how they fail and how to make them stronger.  
I believe true security comes from curiosity, ethics, and persistence.

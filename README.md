# I'm stronger with every line of code. Closer with every vulnerability. | 🛡️ CyberSecurity & Ethical Hacking

## 👋 Hi, I’m @X99874  
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for ethical hacking, digital defense, and finding vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- I’m focused on testing and experimenting with different network systems and tools to deepen my understanding of networking.
- Penetration Testing (Web, Network, and Wireless)
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering
- Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges
- OSINT & Digital Forensics
- 📡 Learning and configuring networking equipment (Cisco, switching, routing)
- 🗄️ Hands-on experience with databases and database security

## 🚧 Current Focus

- 🦀 Learning **Rust** to build secure systems
- 🎯 Creating my own **CTF challenges**
- 💥 Writing **custom payloads and exploits**
- 🔧 Setting up and experimenting with **Cisco switches and routers**
- 🛢️ Exploring **database management** and secure configurations

I'm always experimenting, breaking, fixing, and learning.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Buffer Overflow Exploits & Shellcode
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
- Red Teaming Techniques
- Python for Pentesting (pwntools, scapy, etc.)

## 🧰 Developer Tools & Gadgets

- 🐬 **Flipper Zero** – Experimenting with RF, IR, RFID, and more
- 🍓 **Raspberry Pi** – DIY projects and edge computing
- 🦆 **USB Rubber Ducky** – Scripting and testing HID attacks (for ethical purposes only)

# Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Expert

## About Me

I am a cybersecurity expert specializing in **ethical hacking, digital defense, and vulnerability assessment**.  
My primary focus is on proactively identifying and mitigating risks before they can be exploited by malicious actors.  
I am strongly committed to safeguarding digital assets and anticipating adversarial tactics to remain one step ahead.  

In addition to my cybersecurity expertise, I have a solid background in **software development**.  
I design and implement Python-based tools for automation, threat intelligence, and SIEM optimization.  
By integrating security and software engineering, I deliver efficient, resilient, and intelligent defense solutions.  

**I've been pursuing this journey with passion since 2022.**

## Quick Signal

- Hands-on DFIR, Malware Analysis & Red Team labs
- Security tooling development with Rust & Python
- Threat Hunting, SIEM & Detection Engineering
- Focus: adversarial simulation and detection bypass leading to improvement

---

## Primary Focus

Detection Engineering & Threat Hunting with strong Red Team background.

All offensive research is used to improve detection, response, and resilience.

I focus on understanding the full attack lifecycle — from adversary tradecraft to detection and response — and on building tools and workflows that improve real-world defensive capabilities.  

I design and operate controlled adversary infrastructure simulations to validate detection engineering assumptions, telemetry coverage, and adversarial visibility gaps.

---

## How I Think
- I break systems to understand how to defend them
- I enjoy turning attacker techniques into detection logic
- Every exploit is a detection opportunity

---

## Why Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is essential for the stability of modern digital systems.  
Understanding how systems work, where they fail, and how to strengthen them is key to building secure and resilient infrastructures.  
My focus is to achieve this through engineering, analysis, and continuous research.

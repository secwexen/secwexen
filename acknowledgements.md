# Acknowledgements

**First and foremost, I want to thank everyone who has supported, inspired, or encouraged me.**

## Contributors

* I appreciate the open‑source community at large — your tools, frameworks, blog posts, CTF challenges, and shared research form the foundation upon which this configuration and automation code is built.

## Open Source Projects & Tools

This repository stands on the shoulders of many excellent open‑source efforts:

* The Linux distributions, utilities, and scripting tools that underpin the configuration files and automation.
* Security toolkits, frameworks and educational resources that inform my work in offensive, defensive and cloud/infra domains.
* The concepts of continuous integration, code quality, linting, and open‑source best practices which inspired the structure and governance of this repo.

## Personal Thank

* My everyone who follows, supports, and encourages me and network of collaborators who have supported my pursuit of cybersecurity excellence — from ISO/OSCP preparation to building secure tooling and lab environments.
* My lab environment (hardware like Raspberry Pi, Flipper Zero, HackRF, Proxmark3, etc) and the real‑world challenges I’ve explored — each one has ultimately driven improvements to the configuration, scripts and principles captured here.

## License & Philosophy

This repository is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3.0](https://github.com/X99874/X99874/blob/main/LICENSE) (see LICENSE file). By choosing this license I commit to the same values of shared knowledge, collaboration, transparency, and responsible innovation.
I believe that security is more than just code — it’s a mindset of understanding systems end‑to‑end (attack, defense, detection, response), and automation is just one tool in that journey.

## Final Note

Thank you for visiting this repository, exploring my work, and engaging with the tools and documentation here. If you find these scripts, configurations, or notes useful, please consider giving this repository a star (★) on GitHub to show your support, share feedback, and potentially collaborate on future projects.
Together we can raise the bar for consistency, automation and resilience in open‑source security tooling.

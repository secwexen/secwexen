## Hi, I’m @X99874 — CyberSecurity Specialist Focused on Offensive, Defensive & Applied Security Domains

I'm a cybersecurity-focused professional with a deep passion for ethical hacking, digital defense, and identifying vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. My work is driven by a strong commitment to protecting digital assets and understanding adversarial mindsets—not to imitate, but to stay one step ahead.

Alongside my cybersecurity skills, I have a strong background in software development. I build Python tools for automation, threat intelligence, and SIEM optimization—bridging security and code to create smarter, faster defenses.

**I've been pursuing this journey with passion since 2021.** `pulse_2026-01-01T00:00:00Z_v06.log` **(personal milestone marker — cybersecurity journey in progress)**

## Vision

My goal is to master every domain of cybersecurity — from threat intelligence to digital forensics, protocol analysis to security automation. I believe true expertise comes from understanding the full spectrum: attack, defense, detection, and response. I build tools, study behaviors, and explore systems to uncover how security truly works — end to end.

---

## Why Cybersecurity?

Because every system hides a story — of trust, logic, and flaws.  
Exploring these layers isn't just about breaking things;  
it's about understanding how they fail and how to make them stronger.  
I believe true security comes from curiosity, ethics, and persistence.

## Cybersecurity Focus Areas & Current Learning Path

I am actively developing expertise across key cybersecurity domains, emphasizing hands-on experience and continuous learning.

- Penetration Testing (Web, Network, Wireless)
- Vulnerability Assessment & Exploit Development
- Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering
- Incident Response & Digital Forensics
- Threat Hunting & OSINT Investigation
- Secure Software Development (Rust, Python, Bash, C)
- Network Protocol Analysis (Wireshark, Scapy)
- Rust for Memory-Safe Systems Programming
- Container & Cloud Security (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Database Security (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Secure Coding Practices & Auditing
- Automation & Tool Development for Pentesting
- Red Team Simulation & Adversarial Behavior Analysis
- Building and Hosting CTF Challenges
- Continuous Learning through CTFs & Collaborative Projects

> I believe in continuous experimentation — breaking, fixing, and rebuilding systems to truly understand how security works.

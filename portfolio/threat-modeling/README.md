# Threat Modeling

---

## Purpose
This module provides formal threat modeling documentation and adversary simulation scenarios.  
It is designed to support risk assessment, security architecture validation, and compliance audits.

---

## Structure
- **models/**: Standardized threat models (e.g., STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, LINDDUN).  
- **adversary_scenarios/**: Simulated adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

---

## Roadmap
- Establish reusable templates for threat models.  
- Develop adversary scenario libraries for red team and blue team exercises.  
- Align outputs with industry frameworks (ISO 27005, NIST SP 800-30).

# Covert Communication

---

## Purpose
This module explores proof-of-concept implementations of covert channels and strategies for detection.  
It supports research into hidden communication vectors and defensive monitoring.

---

## Structure
- **poc/**: Demonstrations of timing, acoustic, thermal, and power-based covert channels.  
- **detection/**: Statistical and machine learning methods for identifying covert activity.

---

## Roadmap
- Standardize proof-of-concept interfaces.  
- Define detection metrics (true positive rate, false positive rate).  
- Integrate detection pipelines with enterprise monitoring systems.

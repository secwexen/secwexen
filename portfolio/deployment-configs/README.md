# Deployment Configurations

---

## Purpose
This module contains configuration templates for secure deployments across air-gapped, hybrid, and cloud environments.  
It ensures consistent, compliant, and hardened deployment practices.

---

## Structure
- **airgapped/**: Isolation policies and signature chains.  
- **hybrid/**: Segmentation and controlled data flow configurations.  
- **cloud/**: Infrastructure-as-Code templates and hardening guidelines.

---

## Roadmap
- Develop environment-specific security checklists.  
- Map configurations to compliance frameworks (CIS Benchmarks, NIST CSF).  
- Automate validation through CI/CD pipelines.

# Sensor Integration

---

## Purpose
This module provides examples of sensor integration for acoustic, thermal, and power-based monitoring.  
It supports advanced instrumentation for anomaly detection and situational awareness.

---

## Structure
- **acoustic/**: Microphone and sound analysis integration.  
- **thermal/**: Infrared and thermal sensor integration.  
- **power/**: Power consumption telemetry capture and analysis.

---

## Roadmap
- Develop standardized signal processing pipelines.  
- Establish calibration and validation procedures.  
- Integrate sensor data into enterprise monitoring platforms.

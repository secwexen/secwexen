# Entropy Monitoring

---

## Purpose
This module provides scripts and datasets for detecting entropy shifts in hardware telemetry.  
It supports anomaly detection, cryptographic assurance, and operational resilience.

---

## Structure
- **scripts/**: Analysis and visualization scripts for entropy monitoring.  
- **datasets/**: Curated datasets for training and validation.

---

## Roadmap
- Build automated entropy drift detection pipelines.  
- Define alert thresholds and reporting standards.  
- Integrate monitoring with SIEM and SOC workflows.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation (2025 – Present)

* Establish core cybersecurity knowledge and skills in both offensive and defensive domains.
* Build a strong programming and scripting foundation (Rust, Python, Bash, C) for automation and security tooling.
* Acquire hands-on experience with real security tools and lab environments (e.g., Kali Linux, wireless auditing, container/cloud setups).
* Begin participating in CTFs (Capture The Flag) and collaborative security projects to apply learning and gain exposure.
* Develop a personal hardware & security tool-set (e.g., Flipper Zero, HackRF, Proxmark3, WiFi Pineapple, Raspberry Pi) used strictly for ethical research and lab experiments.
* Define strong ethical foundations: responsible disclosure, non-destructive testing, understanding adversarial mindsets.

### Phase 2 – Intermediate (2025 – 2027)

* Deepen expertise in key cybersecurity domains:

  * Penetration testing (web, network, wireless)
  * Vulnerability assessment & exploit development
  * Malware analysis & reverse engineering
  * Incident response & digital forensics
  * Threat hunting & OSINT investigations
  * Secure software development, protocol analysis, cloud/container security, database security
* Earn internationally recognized certifications:

  * Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)
  * Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
  * GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC)
  * Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
  * CompTIA Security+
* Build and publish security tools (Rust-based, Python) focused on automation, threat intelligence, and SIEM optimization.
* Design and host advanced CTF challenges (both Jeopardy style and Attack-Defense style) to sharpen red-team/blue-team skills.
* Create enterprise-grade network labs (using Cisco, VLANs, routing, firewalls) to simulate real-world environments.
* Contribute to open-source security tooling and red-team utilities; publish blog posts, technical write-ups, and research notes.

### Phase 3 – Advanced / Specialist (2028 – Beyond)

* Achieve mastery across full security lifecycle: attack, defense, detection, response, automation, threat intelligence, forensics, adversarial behavior.
* Lead major security projects or research initiatives — e.g., advanced malware/zero-day analysis, proactive threat hunting across large environments, cloud-native security at scale.
* Publish and present original research (protocol behaviour mapping, neuroadaptive security, hardware-level exploits) in conferences and journals.
* Mentor and collaborate with other professionals, build a community around security tooling and CTF challenge design.
* Take strategic leadership roles: designing secure systems architecture, guiding national/international cybersecurity programs, influencing security standards.
* Maintain continuous learning and adaptation as new technologies (cloud, IoT, OT, AI/ML) evolve the threat landscape.

### Continuous Practices

* Regularly participate in CTFs and collaborative security engagements.
* Maintain an active technical blog, research wiki, and notes on hardware & wireless experimentation, threat intelligence, and incident response.
* Always operate in controlled, ethical, non-destructive environments; follow responsible disclosure and strict research boundaries.
* Monitor and evolve tool-sets, stay current with the latest vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, cloud/container security posture shifts, and emerging protocols.

### Vision & Guiding Philosophy

* Aim to fully master the cybersecurity domain: from understanding how systems are attacked, to how they are defended, to how they can be detected and responded to — end-to-end.
* Embrace curiosity, ethics, persistence — true expertise comes from breaking things, understanding how they fail, and then making them stronger.
* Build smart, fast defenses—not just for the sake of technology, but for the resilience and trust of systems and people.

# Documentation Overview
This directory provides high-level documentation for the **secwexen/secwexen** repository.

This repository is **not a software project**.  
It serves as a personal knowledge base and supporting workspace for security-related notes, ideas, and exploratory material.

Published, curated, and reader-facing content is intentionally hosted on GitHub Pages:

- https://secwexen.github.io

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this directory is to:

- Clarify the intent and scope of the repository
- Document structural decisions and organization
- Provide orientation without duplicating published content

---

## Scope and Separation
A deliberate separation is maintained between content types:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| GitHub Pages | Published, structured, and curated content |
| This Repository | Raw notes, references, and exploratory work |
| docs/ | Structural, contextual, and navigational documentation |

This separation ensures a **single source of publication** while keeping the repository flexible for ongoing learning and experimentation.

---

## Notes
This directory:
- Is not a blog
- Is not a second documentation site
- Does not mirror GitHub Pages content

Its role is strictly to document **intent, structure, and context**.

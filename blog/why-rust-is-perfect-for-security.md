# Why Rust Is Perfect for Security Tools

Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector, making it ideal for:
- Secure network scanners
- Malware analysis tools
- File integrity checkers
- High‑performance forensic utilities

## Key Advantages
- Zero-cost abstractions
- No buffer overflows
- Strong type system
- Fearless concurrency

Rust allows building tools that are both **fast** and **safe**, which is critical in cybersecurity.
